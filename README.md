# revealmd.js

A Node.js application that renders markdown into reveal.js style html.

## Work In Progress.

This is in no means ready for use. Just testing out the waters.

## Running

Just run `$ grunt watch` and any changes made to `index.md` will be converted 
into `index.html` as slides.

## TODO

* Deal with lower level slides.
